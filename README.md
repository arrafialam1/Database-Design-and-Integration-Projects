## Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ SQL Project: Relational Database Design for a YouTube-like Platform

- **Description**:  
  Designed a relational database in PostgreSQL to manage data for a YouTube-like platform, including channels, videos, playlists, and comments.
  
- **Highlights**:  
  - Created tables with appropriate relationships (e.g., `FOREIGN KEYS`).  
  - Inserted real-world data into the database.  
  - Performed complex queries like joins and aggregations.  
  - Automated tasks like data insertion and querying using Python (psycopg2).

- **Tools & Technologies**:  
  - SQL (PostgreSQL), Python, psycopg2  

- **Key Files**:  
  - `create_tables.sql`: SQL script to create tables and insert data.  
  - `python_postgresql.py`: Python script to connect to the database and execute queries.

### 2️⃣ MongoDB Project: NoSQL Database Design for Channel Performance Data

- **Description**:  
  Developed a NoSQL database using MongoDB to store and analyze channel performance data, with features like collections for channels, videos, playlists, and comments.

- **Highlights**:  
  - Implemented collections with well-structured JSON documents.  
  - Performed data insertion and advanced queries using Python (PyMongo).  
  - Demonstrated MongoDB operations like `$lookup` for joining collections and aggregations.

- **Tools & Technologies**:  
  - MongoDB, Python, PyMongo  

- **Key Files**:  
  - `create_collections.py`: Python script to create collections and insert data.  
  - `queries.py`: MongoDB queries and aggregations using PyMongo.
